# Introduction

> The development life cycle definition of projects has gone through decades of refinement.

In order for us to understand the preferred development process of Homegrown Technologies and the reasons that underpin these preferences, we have to appreciate the fundamental best practices defined by our industry as a whole.

This doesn't mean we blindly accept the prescribed methodologies as gospel. We should test these theories and hypothesis set forth by the industry when defining our preferred way of working. 

We should not be satisfied until we've found a process that is both easy to understand and doesn't take away the ability of business to be flexible, adaptable and constantly changing at a moments notice.

This book starts off by highlighting the [seven phases of the software design life cycle](software-development-life-cycle-defined/), which are grouped into 3 pillars that underpins the essence of any software development project.

We will introduce the reader to the popular Agile framework SCRUM and see how these SDLC principles can be applied in an iterative context. The reader is encouraged to adopt an iterative mindset as they progress through this book. 

It's my belief that an incremental and iterative process definition, will give our team the required foundation of stability and flexibility to service the ever changing business climate with a great measure of success.
