# Defining a development process that works for me

This book will serve as my take on the development process as I understand it. This is by no means a definitive guide to "the" development process and if you happen to read this book, don't take the contents as gospel. Always test theories and hypothesis presented by strangers through your own research and come to your own conclusions.

The contents of this book comes from years of experience as a developer, scrum master, development manager and business owner. This book documents the development process that I would like to work with and contains theory from industry best practices.

We kick this book off with the definition of the [software development life cycle](software-development-life-cycle-defined.md), followed by an implementation model of the life cycle using various types of tooling for each section.

The chosen SDLC framework to start with, will be pure SCRUM. You should know however, that this might morph into a more blended Agile approach where I cherry pick what I like best about the various Agile implementations and define my own Framework to work within. I am well aware that this will send up red flags to any purist, be it SCRUM, Kanban, Kaizen or whatever your flavor is.
