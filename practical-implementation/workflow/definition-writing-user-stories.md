# Definition - writing user stories

#### What is a user story?

User stories have a specific format:

 “As a \[persona\],  
I want to \[do something\]  
so that I can \[realize a reward\]”

{% hint style="info" %}
This format is designed to help the story writer be descriptive and to drive better discussions about implementation
{% endhint %}

> Skillful use of stories will improve your outcomes as well as your economics.

The \[persona\] is a humanised, operational description of your user

The \[do something\]  is a goal you assume the user has. 

The \[realize a reward\] clause is a _testable_ statement of how you’ll know if the user realized that goal.

> “As an HR manager, I want to match an open position’s required skills with quiz topics so I can create a quiz relevant for candidate screening.”
