# Definition of Scrum

## Definition of Scrum

Scrum is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques in order to deliver complex solutions.

_Scrum makes clear the relative efficacy \(the ability to produce a desired or intended result\) of your product management and work techniques so that you can continuously improve the product, the team, and the working environment._

In other words, **Scrum is meant to highlight the inefficiencies in the current processes** so that improvements can be made continuously.

Scrum is:

* Lightweight
* Simple to understand
* Difficult to master

The framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrumâ€™s success and usage.

The rules of Scrum bind together the roles, events, and artifacts, governing the relationships and interaction between them.
