# Introduction to Scrum Events

Purpose of events in Scrum:

* Create regularity, consistency and predictability
* Minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum

All scrum events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum duration.

The sprint is a container for all other events and each one of these contained events is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt. Failure to include any of the prescribed events results in reduced transparency and is a lost opportunity to inspect and adapt.
