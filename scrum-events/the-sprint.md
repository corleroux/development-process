# The Sprint

The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, during which a "Done", usable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent duration throughout a development effort and a new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened.

Sprints contain and consist of the

1. [Sprint Planning](sprint-planning.md)
2. [Daily Scrums](daily-scrum.md)
3. Development work
4. [Sprint Review](sprint-review.md)
5. [Sprint Retrospective](sprint-retrospective.md)

During the Sprint:

* No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
* Quality goals do not decrease;
* Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

Sprints are used to accomplish something. Each Sprint has a goal of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product increment.

Sprints are limited to one calendar month at most to

* prevent the definition of what is being built changing
* prevent an unnecessary rise in complexity
* prevent increasing risk
* limit the risk to one calendar month of cost
* enable predictability by ensuring that inspection and adaptation towards progress takes place at least once every calendar month

**Cancelling a Sprint**

A Sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint, although he or she may do so under influence from the stakeholders, the Development Team, or the Scrum Master.

A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the company changes direction or if market or technology conditions change. In general, a Sprint should be cancelled if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances. But, due to the short duration of Sprints, cancellation rarely makes sense.

When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and "Done" Product Backlog items are reviewed. If part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog. The work done on them depreciates quickly and must be frequently re-estimated.

Sprint cancellations consume resources, since everyone regroups in another Sprint Planning to start another Sprint. Sprint cancellations are often traumatic to the Scrum Team, and are very uncommon.
