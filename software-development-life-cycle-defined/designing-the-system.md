# Designing the system

## The Design \(Systems Design\)

### Purpose

High level architectural design of the software, covering the overall system architecture and database design. Following the creation of the design document specification \(DDS\), the stakeholders review, discuss and approve the proposed architecture. _Although not necessary, more than one approach can be proposed and the best solution is picked during the stakeholder review session._

The selected approach, including the feedback from the review session, is signed off by the stakeholders.

The DDS serves as the roadmap for the development phase.

_**The reason the SDLC process requires the planning, definition and design phases before any development can begin, is to eliminate any confusion, inaccuracies and changes to requirements when the actual development work starts.**_

### Input

1. SRS documentation

### Deliverables

1. Signed off design document specification \(DDS\)
2. Project estimates
   * Time & Cost

### Essential requirements

1. Stakeholders review the design plans to re-evaluate the project in terms of:
   * Time
   * Cost
   * Feasibility 
2. Approval of the design specifications

**The time and cost figures presented in this phase should be the final estimates upon which the progress of the project will be measured against.**
