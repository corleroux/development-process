# Implementing the system

## Release to the wild \(Implementation & Deployment\)

### Purpose

The system is deployed to the production environment once it has passed the testing phase. Deployment consists of installing the software and any required hardware for the end users to begin using it.

### Deliverables

1. Detailed deployment plan \(especially if the system is replacing a system already in use\)
   * Including a smoke testing plan post deployment to ensure current functionality as well as any new features work as expected in the production environment.
   * Including a comprehensive rollback plan / strategy in case of catastrophic system failure.
2. Training plan / schedule
   * Including documentation to help end users learn to use the system and any new feature / s that's been deployed.
3. Support handover documentation
   * Including technical documentation detailing the implementation of the system and any feature / s deployed
     * Software perspective
     * Hardware perspective

### Essential requirements

It's essential that the development, testing and infrastructure teams work closely together in order to achieve the deliverables of this phase.

Change controls need to be in place to ensure that all relevant stakeholders are aware of all changes to the production system.

* Change control template
* Change control signoff process
* Change control communication strategy
