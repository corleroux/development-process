# The Development Team

The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. A "Done" increment is required at the Sprint Review and only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Development Teamâ€™s overall efficiency and effectiveness.

Development Teams have the following characteristics:

* They are self-organizing. No one \(not even the Scrum Master\) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
* Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment;
* Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being performed by the person;
* Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of domains that need to be addressed like testing, architecture, operations, or business analysis;
* Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.

#### Development Team Size

Optimal Development Team size is around 5 -7 team members. No less than 3 and no more than 9 members per team. The Scrum Master and Product Owner are not counted in the team size.
